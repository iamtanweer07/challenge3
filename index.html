    <p>
      The third day of the <strong>Commonwealth</strong> Games 2022 was a great
      one for India. After <strong>Jeremy Lalrinnunga</strong>,weightlifter
      Anchita Sheuli clinched the third gold for the country after. Now India's
      number of gold medals has gone up to three. All three golds for India have
      come from the weightlifting camp.
    </p>
    <p>
      Indian weightlifter <b>Achinta Sheuli clinched third gold for India</b>.He
      made a record in the Commonwealth Games by lifting a total of 313 kg
      (143kg+170kg) in the 73 kg category at NEC Hall, Birmingham in the UK. But
      20-year-old Achinta Sheuli, who made us proud today, reached here after a
      lot of struggles.
    </p>
    <p>
      Achinta comes from a humble background; his father used to drive a
      rickshaw but he died when Achinta was very young. He struggled a lot and
      faced many problems. His story inspires others.
    </p>

    <h2 style="color: rgb(196, 43, 4)">Who is Achinta Sheuli?</h2>
    <p>
      Achinta Sheuli, a resident of Deulpur near Howrah, West Bengal, was born
      on 24 November 2001. Given their financial condition, his father Jagat
      Sheuli used to drive a rickshaw and work as a part-time labourer to feed
      the family.
    </p>
    <h2 style="color: rgb(196, 43, 4)">
      He started weightlifting at a very young age
    </h2>
    <p>
      "I loved kite flying and looked up to the 'poush paarbon' every year to
      fly kites and chase them with my friends. But little did I know that I
      would land up in weightlifting," Achinta laughed.
    </p>
    <h2 style="color: rgb(196, 43, 4)">Losing his father</h2>
    <p>
      Nothing came easy to Sheuli. In 2013, Achinta's father suddenly died
      leaving them with broken hearts and looking for ways to survive. His
      mother then took up tailoring work so her children wouldn't starve.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Our village is known for Zari work. So we three (him, mother and brother)
      also started doing embroidery work for contractors. Work would begin at
      6.30 am and would continue till the evening," Achinta told PTI.
    </p>
    <h2 style="color: rgb(196, 43, 4)">
      How his brother helped him in his journey
    </h2>
    <p>
      After his father died, it was very difficult to run the house with the
      money earned by his mother. Achinta's brother Alok dropped out of college,
      gave up weightlifting and became the bread earner of the family.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alok made Achinta's dream his own and fuelled his younger brotherâ€™s
      ambition. He encouraged Achinta and gave him the courage to move forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      According to various reports, his brother<strong> Alok</strong> would
      spend whatever money he used to save on the food Achinta needed for his
      diet. He would give Rs 600-700 every month as pocket money and ensure that
      he continue training.
    </p>
    <h2 style="color: rgb(196, 43, 4)">Indian Army</h2>
    <p>
      The <strong>Indian Army</strong> on Monday hailed and congratulated the
      young athlete who is an Army Havildar. "Indian Army congratulates Havildar
      Achinta Sheuli on winning Gold Medal in Weightlifting by lifting a total

    <h2 style="color: rgb(196, 43, 4)">Hunger for sports</h2>
    <p>
      Achinta's coach said, "I had many players who were physically better than
      Achinta, but they did not have the hunger for sports, which I saw in
      Achinta." Achinta's coach Das left his job at BSF to train him and a few
      others. In view of his financial condition, he trained him for free.
